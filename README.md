# Analysis of CitiBike Use during September of 2015, 2017, and 2019
Due to a file size that is above what is accepted by Github, I added links to download both my Tableau Workbook as well as the three CSV files from the CitiBike website. The CSV files need to be extracted from their Zip file and then union the 2017 and 2019 files under the 2015 file.
Links for accessing the necessary CSVs:

  - September 2017: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/201709-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip
  - September 2019: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/201909-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip
